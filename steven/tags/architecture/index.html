        <p>
            The book Dependency Injection Principles, Practices, and Patterns has gone to print. For the last two years I&rsquo;ve been coauthoring the book Dependency Injection Principles, Practices, and Patterns. This is a revised and expanded edition of Manning&rsquo;s bestselling classic Dependency Injection in .NET by Mark Seemann.
I always loved the first edition as it was a game changer for me. I learned a lot about DI, DI Containers, and software design.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            When Dependency Injection is applied correctly and completely it is important that each type only has one constructor - multiple constructors are redundant, make your DI configuration fragile, and lead to maintainability issues. rom a dependency injection perspective, our applications have two kinds of types: newables and injectables. Newables are classes that the application news up manually using the new keyword. This is true for types such as primitives, entities, DTOs, view models and messages.

        <p>
            Announcing the new major release of Simple Injector. The Simple Injector is an easy-to-use Inversion of Control library for .NET and Silverlight. Last week Simple Injector 2 was released. This release was a major undertaking. I&rsquo;ve been working on this release full time for the last few months and I got a lot of help from enthusiastic Simple Injector users and even got a new developer on the team. I think the results are awesome.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            When it comes to writing maintainable software, there is no alternative to the five core principles of object-oriented design. When software is based on these principles, everything becomes significantly easier. When your software is based on these principles, writing a highly maintainable WCF web service on top of that can be done in just a matter of minutes. The code supporting this article can be found at github.com/dotnetjunkie/solidservices. Most of my clients have maintainability issues with their software.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            This article extends the architectural design of command handlers to allow command handlers to return data. UPDATE: Although the article below might still be very entertaining, my opionion on the subject has changed. The problems described below will go away completely when you stop using use database generated IDs! Instead let the consumer of that command generate an ID (most likely a GUID). In this case, since the client creates the ID, they already have that value, and you don&rsquo;t have to return anything.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Command-query separation is a common concept in the software industry. Many architectures separate commands from the rest of the system and send command messages that are processed by command handlers. This same concept of messages and handlers can just as easily be applied to the query side of an architecture. There are not many systems using this technique and this article is an attempt to change that. Two simple interfaces will change the look of your architecture&hellip; forever.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            This article describes how a single interface can transform the design of your application to be much cleaner, and more flexible than you ever thought possible. Chapter 10 of my book contains a much more elaborate version of this article. Since I began writing applications in .NET I&rsquo;ve been separating operations that mutate state (of the database mostly) from operations that return data. This is basically what the Command-query separation principle is about.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            The Microsoft ADO.NET team blog made an important announcement yesterday about the future of LINQ to SQL. The ADO.NET team announced that Microsoft will continue to make some investments in LINQ to SQL, but they also made it pretty clear that LINQ to Entities is the recommended data access solution in the future frameworks. Microsoft will invest heavily in the Entity Framework.
I always wondered why Microsoft focused on two different O/RM technologies for the .
