        <p>
            To be able to achieve anything useful, your application code makes use of runtime data that comes in many shapes and forms. Providing access to that data can be accomplished in many ways. The way you provide object graphs with runtime data can affect the way you compose them using Dependency Injection. There are two competing models to choose from. This article describes the less common model: the Ambient Composition Model.

            The book Dependency Injection Principles, Practices, and Patterns has gone to print. For the last two years I&rsquo;ve been coauthoring the book Dependency Injection Principles, Practices, and Patterns. This is a revised and expanded edition of Manning&rsquo;s bestselling classic Dependency Injection in .NET by Mark Seemann.
I always loved the first edition as it was a game changer for me. I learned a lot about DI, DI Containers, and software design.

             For the last months we’ve been working on the next major release of Simple Injector, and it is finally here. We have removed legacy methods, simplified working with the library, and fixed many bugs and quirks. Take a look at the Simple Injector blog for more information about this new major release.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            When it comes to writing LOB applications, abstract factories are a code smell as they increase the complexity of the consumer instead of reducing it. This article describes why and offers alternatives. The Abstract Factory design pattern decouples the creation of a family of objects from usage. Compared to injecting a service into a constructor, a factory allows objects to be created lazily, instead of up front during object-graph composition.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">Dependency Injection Code Smell: Injecting runtime data into components</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Injecting runtime data into your application components is a code smell. Runtime data should flow through the method calls of already-constructed object graphs. A recurring theme when it comes to questions about dependency injection is how to wire up and resolve components a.k.a. injectables (the classes that contain the application&rsquo;s behavior) that require runtime data during construction. My answer to this is always the same:
 Don&rsquo;t inject runtime data into application components during construction&mdash;it causes ambiguity, complicates the Composition Root with an extra responsibility, and makes it extraordinarily hard to verify the correctness of your DI configuration.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            A number of common frameworks have promoted the concept of using attributes as a way of implementing AOP. On the surface this seems perfectly acceptable but in reality the maintainability of these options degrades as you add behaviors by injecting dependencies into attributes. The point of this article is “don’t do it!” There are better ways and this article will describe one such alternative. A long time has passed since the early formative stages of the .

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            When Dependency Injection is applied correctly and completely it is important that each type only has one constructor—multiple constructors are redundant, make your DI configuration fragile, and lead to maintainability issues. From a DI perspective, your applications have two kinds of types: newables and injectables. Newables are classes that the application news up manually using the new keyword. This is true for types such as primitives, entities, DTOs, view models and messages.

            Announcing the new major release of Simple Injector. The Simple Injector is an easy-to-use Inversion of Control library for .NET and Silverlight. Last week Simple Injector 2 was released. This release was a major undertaking. I&rsquo;ve been working on this release full time for the last few months and I got a lot of help from enthusiastic Simple Injector users and even got a new developer on the team. I think the results are awesome.

        <p>
            When it comes to writing maintainable software, there is no alternative to the five core principles of object-oriented design. When software is based on these principles, everything becomes significantly easier. When your software is based on these principles, writing a highly maintainable WCF web service on top of that can be done in just a matter of minutes. The code supporting this article can be found at github.com/dotnetjunkie/solidservices. Most of my clients have maintainability issues with their software.

        <p>
            This article extends the architectural design of command handlers to allow command handlers to return data. UPDATE: Although the article below might still be very entertaining, my opionion on the subject has changed. The problems described below will go away completely when you stop using use database generated IDs! Instead let the consumer of that command generate an ID (most likely a GUID). In this case, since the client creates the ID, they already have that value, and you don&rsquo;t have to return anything.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Command-query separation is a common concept in the software industry. Many architectures separate commands from the rest of the system and send command messages that are processed by command handlers. This same concept of messages and handlers can just as easily be applied to the query side of an architecture. There are not many systems using this technique and this article is an attempt to change that. Two simple interfaces will change the look of your architecture&hellip; forever.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            This article describes how a single interface can transform the design of your application to be much cleaner, and more flexible than you ever thought possible. Chapter 10 of my book contains a much more elaborate version of this article. Since I began writing applications in .NET I&rsquo;ve been separating operations that mutate state (of the database mostly) from operations that return data. This is basically what the Command-query separation principle is about.
