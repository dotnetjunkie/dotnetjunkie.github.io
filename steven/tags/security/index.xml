      <description>Bryan Sullivan describes in the May issue of his MSDN article a denial of service attack that abuses regular expressions. As Bryan explains, a poorly written regex can bring your server to its knees. Bryan demonstrates that even the simplest regular expressions can bring your server to its knees. Here are some examples of regular expressions that can easily cause this to happen:
^(\d+)+$ ^(\d+)*$ ^(\d*)*$ ^(\d+|\s+)*$ ^(\d|\d\d)+$ ^(\d|\d?)+$ Read more about the causes and the cures here.</description>

      <description>Tom Hollander describes on his blog a denial of service attack I never knew the existence of, called XML Entity Expansion attack. Tom explains how to bring a server to its knees when allowing any type of xml document as input and passing it directly to an XmlDocument for parsing. Tom uses the following XML document of less than 1 KB to demonstrate the attack:
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE foo [ &amp;lt;!ENTITY a &amp;#34;1234567890&amp;#34; &amp;gt; &amp;lt;!</description>
