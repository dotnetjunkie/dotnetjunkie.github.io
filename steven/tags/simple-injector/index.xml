      <description> For the last months we’ve been working on the next major release of Simple Injector, and it is finally here. We have removed legacy methods, simplified working with the library, and fixed many bugs and quirks. Take a look at the Simple Injector blog for more information about this new major release.

      <description>Announcing the new major release of Simple Injector. The Simple Injector is an easy-to-use Inversion of Control library for .NET and Silverlight. Last week Simple Injector 2 was released. This release was a major undertaking. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this release full time for the last few months and I got a lot of help from enthusiastic Simple Injector users and even got a new developer on the team. I think the results are awesome.</description>

      <title>Returning data from command handlers</title>

      <description>This article extends the architectural design of command handlers to allow command handlers to return data. UPDATE: Although the article below might still be very entertaining, my opionion on the subject has changed. The problems described below will go away completely when you stop using use database generated IDs! Instead let the consumer of that command generate an ID (most likely a GUID). In this case, since the client creates the ID, they already have that value, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to return anything.</description>

      <title>Adding Covariance and Contravariance to Simple Injector</title>

      <description>A few weeks back I read this question on Stack Overflow. The question was about applying covariance / contravariance (or variance for short) to the Autofac dependency injection container. The question triggered me to think about variance support in Simple Injector. I was wondering whether special changes were needed to the core framework to allow this. However, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take me long to realize that enabling variance is actually pretty easy for anyone using the Simple Injector.</description>

      <description>The Microsoft ADO.NET team blog made an important announcement yesterday about the future of LINQ to SQL. The ADO.NET team announced that Microsoft will continue to make some investments in LINQ to SQL, but they also made it pretty clear that LINQ to Entities is the recommended data access solution in the future frameworks. Microsoft will invest heavily in the Entity Framework.
I always wondered why Microsoft focused on two different O/RM technologies for the .</description>
